# Javascript/React - Memory Game

For this project I created a memory game

- The project is set up with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
- I used react hooks (useState ans useEffect).
- I used styled-components.
- Code is commented so you can see what each part is doing.
- I also created the cards by splicing together background images and png's (with no background) that I found online.
